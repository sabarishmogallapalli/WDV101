<h3 class="center">About Me!</h3>
<p class="center"><img src="./DSC00597.jpg" width="399" height=auto></p>
<p class="center">I am a passionate, versatile, and innovative senior at <a href = "https://northwest.waukeeschools.org" target="blank">Northwest High School</a> currently working as a Customer Success Intern side by side with the Auction Success Team at <a href="https://tractorzoom.com" target="_blank">Tractor Zoom</a>. I help process equipment information that will ultimately be used in the Iron Comps by Tractor Zoom software to help banks, dealers, and farmers make better financial decisions. I plan to pursue a major in Management Information Systems. I am interested in careers related to Web and Application Development and Design, Information Technology Consultancy, Business Data analytics, and Software Programming. I understand attributes that matter to buyers and sellers and tailor my work to ensure that I reach their needs. I currently plan on attending the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and intend to graduate with a degree in Information Sciences. I would like to be a web developer in the future.</p>
