        <p class="firstParagraph">Cocoa, when consumed as a powder or as dark chocolate, can help reduce blood pressure level.

These flavonals also improves blood supply content to the brain. The <em>polyphenols</em> found in cocoa, which increases blood flow and brain function, reduce the risk of gaining neurodegenerative disease. Cocoa powder also contain polyphenols, an antioxidant that improves cholesterol and blood sugar and therefore reduces risk of heart disease.
