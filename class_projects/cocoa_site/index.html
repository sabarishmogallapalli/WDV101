        <p>It was first developed as a crop by the <em>Aztechs</em> and <em>Mayans</em> thousands of years ago. The <em>Maya</em> <em>Toltec</em> and <em>Aztec</em> people used the bean to create a beverage which they used as a ceremonial drink. The ceremonial drink was created by using sun-feremented bean pods which were roasted then grounded to a paste. Vanilla, occasionally corn, and an assortment of spices were added. The paste was then formed into cake-like structures and were cooled till they hardened. The cakes were mixed with hot water to create the drink <em>xocoatl</em>.</p>

        <p>It was exclusively used by the native cultures in these lands until the Spanish Conquistadors arrived on their land and seized the crop after finding its true value. During <em>Christopher Columbus's</em> fourth voyage, he took cocoa beans to Spain. Since then cocoa beans were used in South American cultures and soon spread throughout the world. They utilized the native cocoa to make a drink by mixing in sweeteners and adding spice. As the drink populated across Europe, Europeans believed the drink to be too bitter and added sugar. Through this process, they soon developed chocolate, which soon spread into and across Europe.</p>

        <p>In order for cocoa to be used in the assortment of products, the cocoa bean has to be processed. The process cocoa beans undergo is broken up into multiple phases: harvesting, fermentation, cleaning, roasting, grinding, conching, and molding.</p></section>

        <p>The chocolate was primarily used as a drink and, what is now known as hot chocolate, became a royalty favorite across Europe. Chocolateâ€™s value was in part because of its exclusivity and scarcity. This exclusivity diminished in the industrial revolution when the process of creating cocoa powder became more efficient and affordable. Today over <strong>4,500,000</strong> tons of cocoa beans are used annually across the globe, in various cuisines and dishes like chocolate, coffee, and others.</p>
