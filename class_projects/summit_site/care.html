    <h2>Training</h2>
    <p class="center">Every dog owner should devote ample amounts of time towards training their companion. Training a dog ensures the safety of the dog and other’s around the dog. Alaskan dogs should first be taught the regular commands to teach the dog to be obedient. This training involves teaching the dog the following commands: sit, down, come, leave it, off, and heel. The sit command will be helpful to keep the dog under control in any situation. The down command will help calm the dog down at any time and will ensure that the dog stays in a certain place. The come command will ensure that the dog returns to the owner whenever called. The leave it command can also ensure that the dog doesn’t meddle with items that can pose a threat to his/her life. The off command teaches the dog to stay off of people and furniture if the dog shouldn’t be there. Finally the heel command tells the dog to accompany you by being beside you. In addition to these rudimentary commands, an owner of an Alaskan dog should teach the dog some tricks like shake and stay to ensure their obedience and good behavior. Alaskan dog breeds are very giddy and tend to be energetic and are ready to pounce and start a fight so it is very important to train them to conserve their energy and practice obedience. Alaskan dogs tend to enjoy and easily learn tasks that involve pulling. These tasks include: scooter pulling, sledding, snow shoeing, and even ATV pulling.

    <h2>Grooming</h2>
    <p class="center">Unlike most other dogs, Alaskan dog breeds have a double coat. The double coat contains one that will keep the dog warm throughout the winter and a weather proof top coat that has guard hairs that grow through the undercoat. The outer coat is very helpful and handy to keep the dog clean as dirt and mud usually just brushes off the fur, allowing for easy maintenance. Between the ages of 10 to 14 months, Alaskan puppy breeds shed their puppy fur which is replaced by a full adult coat. The double coat on the Alaskan dog may look very thick and exhaustive to the owner. In reality, the dog’s guard hairs have air pockets that provide protection from UV rays and allow for breathability. Clipping and Shaving an Alaskan dog’s fur make the dog prone to skin disease. Owner’s should be aware that during the months leading up to spring and warm weather, Alaskan dog breeds shed their fur. This can result in trash bags filled with fur! This can lead to an abundance of fur stuck to clothes, furniture, and other appliances. It would be handy to have several vacuum cleaners lint rollers, undercoat rakes, furminator brushes, and shedding blades to aid in cleaning up after the furry companion. Alaskan dogs don’t have very oily coats so they only need to be bathed a few times every year. It is better to bathe them fewer than more to avoid drying out their fur and skin. It also convenient that they don’t need any special shampoo. Instead, buy an organic shampoo to use on the dog.

    <h2>Health</h2>
    <p class="center">Alaskan dog breeds tend to be extremely healthy. Originating from the north, they are instinctively adaptive to colder weathers and don’t get sick from these environments and during the change of seasons. Certain breeds may have some allergies and some health issues so it is important to continue monitoring your dog and taking it to regular checkups.

    <h2>Nutrition</h2>
    <p class="center">Due to the size and activeness of Alaskan dog breeds, these dogs require a protein-dense diet. Most of their protein should come from fish, fowl, or other grassland animals. Red meat should constitute a smaller portion of their protein intake. It is also a good idea to add rabbit, elk, and bison meat to the diet to add a variety for the breed. The Alaskan dog breed’s diet should include a 30% protein intake, 30% carbohydrate intake, 20% fat intake in each meal. The fat intake should continue to be quality fat derived from whole meat sources. The carbohydrates should include a variation of beans, fruits, seeds, and vegetables. In addition to these dietary pillars, owner’s should also supply the dog with natural sources of vitamins, minerals, and supplements to ensure that the dog is healthy. In addition to supplying the dog with a good diet, it is also important that the dog has enough food in its system. The amount of food intake will depend on the age, breed, activity levels, and other factors but generally Alaskan dog breeds will tend to eat more due to their high energy levels. Alaskan puppy breeds should be fed a breed appropriate food and an age appropriate food as well. Puppy formulation should also be fed to the puppy. Owners should supply larger dogs with a Large Breed Formulation.
