    <p class="center">Alaskan dogs all originated from the cold north. The larger Alaskan dogs were used to hunt, herd, and guard. The smaller Alaskan dogs were used primarily as household pets. It is speculated that these dogs were from Asia and migrated during the last ice age. Alaskan dogs are specified as Spitz Dogs. Spitz Dogs can withstand cold and harsh weather climates and are therefore referred to as Northern Breeds. Species of Alaskan dogs have similar features that make them easily distinguishable.</p>
