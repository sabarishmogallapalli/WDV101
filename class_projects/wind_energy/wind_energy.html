<h2>The one place to find all the information about wind energy</h2>

<p>In <strong>1850</strong>, a wind energy company was created where they created the first windmill, the predecessor of a wind turbine, to be used to pump water and create electricity. In <strong>1890</strong>, steel blades were manufactured to be used for wind turbines. In <strong>1980</strong>, the first windmill farm was built in California. </p>
<p>Wind energy is very helpful to the environment. It is very cost-effective because it is naturally derived. It is a clean source of fuel for the environment. It is an unlimited source of energy because of the plentiful amount of winds. It is also renewable and free to use.</p>
<p>Wind energy also can be harmful to the environment. The environment needed to house these wind turbines are often far away from cities, where the energy is needed, and long power lines are needed to transport the energy. Turbines are also known to cause noise pollution and aesthetic pollution to environments. Wind turbines have also been the cause of death for many birds and bats, who were killed by running into or getting sliced by the blades.</p>
<p>The wind vision report found key findings revolving around the future of wind energy. The report said that wind energy can be a source of renewable energy in every state in the United States by <strong>2050</strong>, replacing the use of <strong><em>12.3 gigatonnes of greenhouse gases</em></strong>. This development will also create over <strong><em>600,000 jobs</em></strong> related to the production and maintenance of wind energy by <strong>2050</strong>. It will save users over <strong>280</strong> billion dollars by <strong>2050</strong>. The use of wind energy will preserve <strong>260</strong> billion gallons of water.</p>
